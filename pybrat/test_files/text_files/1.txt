                     Seroprevalence of tick-borne and mosquito-borne arboviruses in European brown hares in Northern and Western Germany.       Tribec virus (Kemerovo serogroup, genus Orbivirus), Eyach virus (genus Coltivirus), and Tahyna virus (California encephalitis serogroup, genus Bunyavirus) are arthropod-borne viruses known to occur in Germany. These viruses are also suspected to cause human disease. So far, no information is available on their geographical distribution in Germany and their natural transmission cycles. A total of 166 sera from European brown hares (Lepus europaeus) collected in seven districts of the Federal State of Schleswig-Holstein and in four districts of the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia was tested by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) for antibodies against Tribec virus, Eyach virus, Tahyna virus, and Central European encephalitis virus. One out of 22 sera (4.5%) collected in the district Nord-Friesland in Schleswig-Holstein was found positive (PRNT(90) 1:10) against Tribec virus. Neither did sera from other regions of Schleswig-Holstein nor from hares from North Rhine-Westphalia react against any of the arboviruses tested. For the first time, antibodies against Tribec virus could be found in a European brown hare in Germany. The negative serological results for Central European encephalitis virus are in line with the current knowledge of its natural distribution within Germany. The negative serological results for Tahyna virus or Eyach virus argue against an autochthonous circulation of these viruses in the regions tested.
